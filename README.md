# gallery.py

A Python implementation of Elder and McCammond's method to check Gromov's link condition for vertices

## Requirements
Python 3, Regina (regina-normal) 7
    
## Dependencies:
- SAGE, or
- [`constructible.py`](https://github.com/leovt/constructible): To use a different underlying constructible number object, simply
        change what `constrsphtrig.sqrt` refers to after importing. (If
        `constructible.py` is not available create a file with stub variables
        `sqrt` and `Constructible`.)
